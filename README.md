# Volt: Pay by Bank - Magento 2 Payment Module

## Description
Offer shoppers a faster, safer way to pay. With Volt, your customers can check out directly from their banking app. No card required.

How does it work? Well, they simply choose ‘Pay by Bank’ at checkout, select their bank and confirm the payment details in their online banking environment. ‘Pay by Bank’ will appear as an option alongside the payment methods you already accept.

Because payments are account-to-account, you’ll receive the funds in real time and at a fraction of the cost of card payments – while giving your customers a slicker payment experience.

Watch the "Pay by Bank" experience in action [here](https://www.volt.io/demos/checkout/).
